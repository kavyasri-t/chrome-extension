# CommandPlus

Created for and during NUS Hack&Roll 2017.

CommandPlus is a Chrome extension that provides hand gesture-based control of one's browser. It does this by interacting with the user's webcam and sending video frames from the live feed to a Python [server](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/CommandPlus-Server) running OpenCV for gesture detection using computer vision. If one of the predefined gestures is detected, CommandPlus triggers the relevant action in the browser. The extension is aimed at helping individuals who are limited in their movement or fine motor skills.
